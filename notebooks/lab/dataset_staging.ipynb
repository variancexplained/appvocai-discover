       "9332   I’ve mainly played Minecraft education on the school laptop and decided to play it again over summer break. Sign in and the game is the same, but the controls are sort of weird. The WASD is replaced with arrows, which makes moving around take more effort than it should. I was thinking maybe replace the arrows with a joystick like Roblox mobile has. It also took me a few minutes to figure out how to stop flying (I imported a world where I saved while I was flying) since you have to be up in the air to stop and can’t deactivate it while you’re ~2 blocks from the ground.   \n",
