I was having problems and discovered my battery was low because I wasn’t driving the car enough. The ability to save POI when transferred would be a good enhancement.   \n",

       "24198   This app has taken me from zero knowledge of German to pretty confident as a casual speaker. - It of course lacks the real life conversation element, but they are moving in a promising direction with their new bots. Otherwise, skills reach a plateau. Bots could allow more variance in answers accepted, but I understand the importance of reflecting a certain question with an appropriate, mirroring answer.   \n",
