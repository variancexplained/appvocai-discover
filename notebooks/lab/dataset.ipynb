As of lately I was not able to sign in on a different phone which of course I brushed off because I was signed into a different phone and I thought that’s why it wasn’t letting me. Now as I said I didn’t think anything of it, but when I logged out of the phone I was signed into (because I was going to log into my shared account @ItsOnlyUsInTheEnd) well when I went to log in it again wouldn’t let me, but this time it would not let me sign into either one. It claims Wattpad doesn’t have my account when I know it does. I love Wattpad with all of my heart. It’s where I met my best friends and where I met my new favorite author (Jakayla Toney). I have 12 published books some of which that are no where finished. Anyways my point to all this is please find out what’s wrong.

       "4629    Hello I’m Alexis (Siren Hathaway) other wise known as a small book author with 203 followers. My account is @ItsOnlySiren and I have had this account for four years. As of lately I was not able to sign in on a different phone which of course I brushed off because I was signed into a different phone and I thought that’s why it wasn’t letting me. Now as I said I didn’t think anything of it, but when I logged out of the phone I was signed into (because I was going to log into my shared account @ItsOnlyUsInTheEnd) well when I went to log in it again wouldn’t let me, but this time it would not let me sign into either one. It claims Wattpad doesn’t have my account when I know it does. I love Wattpad with all of my heart. It’s where I met my best friends and where I met my new favorite author (Jakayla Toney). I have 12 published books some of which that are no where finished. Anyways my point to all this is please find out what’s wrong. I would love to get my account back and all the work I put into my books.   \n",

But this does just that by targeting the needs of runners! Great app and easy to use, I highly recommend adding this to your arsenal if you’re serious about improving your overall fitness and avoiding injuries. One recommendation for the developers: if someone doesn’t know the area they are having a problem with, can a “click here” feature be added and then asks more details about specific area? Then from there a formula picks out the area that’s affected   \n",

Some people don’t have the privilege of having money to spend on apps. I am a teenager who is being raise by a single parent who can’t afford to spend money on devotionals. I am trying to pay my way through college and have additional bills. It’s sad you charge people to worship with you. This is a shame. Absolutely shameful.   \n",
