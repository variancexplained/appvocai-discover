    "# AppVoCAI Dataset Enrichment and Aggregation\n",
    "The Data Enrichment and Aggregation module is designed to transform raw app review data into actionable insights by enhancing and summarizing key features. This module begins by incorporating critical review metadata, such as review length and review age, to provide context on the scale and recency of user feedback. It then applies sentiment classification of each review, followed by a review quality assessment to filter for high-value content. Deviation analysis is performed to identify outliers and assess how individual reviews compare to broader patterns. The enriched data is subsequently aggregated at both the app and category levels, enabling a view of performance and sentiment trends across the mobile app ecosystem."

In this section, we integrate two complementary quality assessment measures—a lexical/syntactic score and a perplexity-based score—into a weighted sum. This approach provides a balanced evaluation, capturing both the structural diversity and natural language fluency of the reviews.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **POS Count Score (40%)**: Reflects the richness of content using counts of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.\n",
    "2. **POS Diversity Score (20%)**: Captures variety in language using an entropy-based calculation.\n",
    "3. **POS Intensity Score (10%)**: Assesses the density of key parts of speech relative to total word count.\n",
    "4. **Structural Complexity Score (20%)**: Evaluates text complexity using unique word proportion, special character usage, and word length variation.\n",
    "5. **TQA Check Score (10%)**: Incorporates quality signals such as limited digit use, minimal special characters, and proper terminal punctuation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Perplexity-Based Quality Assessment  \n",
    "This measure evaluates review quality by applying 13 linguistic and structural filters, each assigned a weight derived from relative perplexity differences between the full dataset and filtered subsets. The filters assess features like adjective presence, punctuation ratios, word repetition, and special character use. Weights are computed to emphasize filters that most reduce perplexity, thus enhancing text fluency and coherence. The final score is a weighted sum of these filter indicators. \n",
