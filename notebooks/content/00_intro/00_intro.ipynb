                "\n",
                "At the 1983 International Design Conference, Steve Jobs described an ecosystem where consumers would effortlessly access, purchase, and download software directly onto 'an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you' {cite}`stevejobsTalkStevenJobs1983`. Fast forward 25 years to July 10, 2008, and Apple materialized Jobs' foresight with the launch of the App Store, an event that revolutionized how technology is acquired, engaged, and integrated into daily life. One of the world's first commercially successful mobile app marketplaces, the App Store stands as a digital leviathan, boasting a staggering 1,928,363 apps and catering to over 1.3 billion iOS users worldwide {cite}`agIOSAppleApp`.\n",
                "\n",
                "> \"Because we offer nearly two million apps — and we want you to feel good about using every single one of them.\" - Apple\n",

                "User feedback, manifested through ratings and reviews, serves as a critical component of App Store Optimization (ASO), influencing app discoverability, user engagement, and financial outcomes for developers. However, despite the ubiquity and strategic importance of user reviews, there remains a dearth of large-scale datasets dedicated to comprehensive analysis of the *mobile app* user experiences.\n",

                "### Literature Context\n",
                "\n",
                "The motivation behind the AppVoC (App Voice of the Customer) project draws upon foundational literature in user experience research, sentiment analysis, and consumer behavior within digital platforms. Studies by Sällberg, Wang, and Numminen (2023) emphasize the significance of user reviews in shaping perceptions and adoption of mobile apps, providing insights into sentiment analysis and thematic categorization {cite}`sallbergCombinatoryRoleOnline2023`. Additionally, theoretical frameworks such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT) offer lenses through which to interpret user behaviors and motivations in the context of app interactions {cite}`davisPerceivedUsefulnessPerceived1989` {cite}`katzUsesGratificationsResearch1973`.\n",
                "\n",
                "Furthermore, the unified theoretical model proposed by Tas, Huseynov, and Kose (2024) integrates various theories and empirical data to comprehensively explain mobile application usage behavior, supported by real usage data. This model contributes significantly to understanding user motivations, preferences, and decision-making processes in digital environments {cite}`tasUnifiedTheoreticalModel2024`.\n",

                "\n",
                "Existing review datasets like Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB have been invaluable for research in consumer behavior. These datasets are accessible and widely adopted, providing a rich source of information that has contributed significantly to understanding purchasing decisions, service satisfaction, and entertainment preferences. They serve as benchmark datasets, helping researchers develop and validate models that predict consumer behavior, sentiment, and preferences. The insights derived from these reviews have driven advancements in recommendation systems, personalized marketing, and sentiment analysis, showcasing their utility and importance in the field.\n",
                "\n",
                "Yet, these benchmark datasets primarily focus on product choices, service quality, and entertainment preferences. They provide valuable insights but fall short of capturing the profound impact of technology on consumer behavior, human interactions, and capabilities. The unique and transformative nature of mobile app usage, where technology seamlessly integrates into our daily routines through smartphones, wearables, and other devices, necessitates a specialized dataset. This is where the AppVoC dataset becomes essential. Mobile app reviews serve as a historical record of this technological evolution, capturing user experiences, challenges, and adaptations in real time. These reviews document the gradual yet significant shifts in human behavior and interaction brought about by technological advancements, providing a rich source of data for understanding this ongoing evolution. The AppVoC Dataset is not just another collection of reviews; it is a critical resource for documenting and driving the next stages of the human/technological nexus.\n",
