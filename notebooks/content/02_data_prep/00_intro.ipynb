    "# AppVOC Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "In advance of the exploratory and interactive analyses,  our aim for the next few sections is to ensure that the text data are clean, structured, and ready for in-depth examination and modeling. With that, our six-stage data preprocessing effort will unfold as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Normalization**: Standardize data types and encoding to resolve technical anomalies before further processing and analysis.\n",
    "2. **Data Quality Analysis**: Identify and rectify noise within the dataset, including profanity, excessive special characters, and identifiable patterns like emails and URLs.\n",
    "3. **Cleaning**: Purge biased or distorted observations detected during the data quality analysis, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering**: Enhance data by transforming date fields into informative features such as month, day of the week, and day of the month. Additionally, anonymize author information to uphold privacy.\n",
    "5. **Text Preprocessing**: Optimize textual data for downstream tasks such as word cloud generation and topic modeling, utilizing techniques like tokenization and stemming.\n",
    "6. **Metrics**: Establish an Analytics Precomputation Layer (APL) to calculate aggregate statistical summaries, facilitating swift query responses and cost-effective analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These next steps will ensure that the dataset is clean, consistent, and well-structured for exploratory data analysis. Next up? Data quality analysis."
