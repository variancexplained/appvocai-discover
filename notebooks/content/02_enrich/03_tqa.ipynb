    "# Review Text Quality Assessment (TQA) \n",
    "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) model self-training and fine-tuning requires text saturated with explicit aspects and opinions words. Dense, unambiguous, aspect-rich reviews are especially vital during ABSA model self-training and pseudo-labeling. Explicit aspect-opinion pair relationships minimize noise and reinforce the modelâ€™s understanding of aspect-sentiment associations. Here, we assess the degree to which each review manifests this richness, enabling targeted sample selection for optimal self-training and ABSA model fine-tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Quality Scoring \n",
    "Text quality in our context is less about fluency or lexical sophistication in the traditional linguistic sense; we're not grading essays. Instead, we focus on whether reviews contain clear aspects and opinions, reflected through specific syntactic features, such as the density of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. Our scoring method assigns weighted values to key syntactic components that drive aspect-based sentiment analysis. We calculate the **Syntactic Score** using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Syntactic Score} = 0.3 \\times \\text{Noun Density} + 0.3 \\times \\text{Adjective Density} + 0.2 \\times \\text{Verb Density} + 0.2 \\times \\text{Adverb Density}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, nouns $w_N = 0.3$ anchor aspect identification, while adjectives $w_A = 0.3$ capture sentiment polarity. Verbs $w_V = 0.2$ add contextual sentiment nuances, and adverbs $w_{ADV} = 0.2$ convey intensity. We combine this **Syntactic Score** with a **Lexical Diversity Score (TTR)** to derive a comprehensive **Text Quality Score**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Text Quality Score Raw} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{Syntactic Score} + \\beta \\cdot \\text{Lexical Diversity Score (TTR)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha=0.5$ and $\\beta=0.5$ adjust the relative importance of syntactic richness and lexical diversity, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we scale $\\text{Text Quality Score}$ to the range $[0,100]$"
