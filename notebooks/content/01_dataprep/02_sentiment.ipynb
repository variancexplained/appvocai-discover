    "## Sentiment Analysis Task\n",
    "The `SentimentAnalysisTask` class performs sentiment analysis on text data using the `tabularisai/robust-sentiment-analysis` pre-trained transformer model. It is built to handle large-scale text data efficiently and is optimized for execution on GPU when available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Technical Aspects**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Loading**: The transformer is loaded using the Hugging Face `transformers` library, leveraging both the `AutoTokenizer` for text tokenization and `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` for sentiment classification.\n",
    "2. **Hardware Optimization**: The class supports GPU acceleration through PyTorch. It checks for the availability of a CUDA-compatible GPU and moves the model and data to the GPU if available. This significantly speeds up inference, making it suitable for large datasets.\n",
    "3. **Text Preprocessing and Tokenization**: Text data is preprocessed and tokenized using the `AutoTokenizer`, which converts text into input tensors that the model can process. The inputs are truncated or padded to a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens, ensuring consistency in input size.\n",
    "4. **Memory Management**: The class uses `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` to clear CUDA memory before loading the model, optimizing memory usage and preventing potential out-of-memory errors on the GPU.\n",
    "5. **Sentiment Prediction**: The `predict_sentiment` method performs inference using `torch.no_grad()` to disable gradient calculation, reducing memory consumption and speeding up computations. It calculates class probabilities using the `softmax` function and maps the predicted class index to a sentiment label.\n",
    "6. **Caching Mechanism**: The class constructs a cache file path using environment-specific settings, making it possible to store and reuse sentiment analysis results efficiently. This can help avoid redundant computations and improve the overall performance of the data pipeline.\n",
    "7. **Integration with DataFrames**: The class operates on pandas DataFrames, applying sentiment analysis to each entry in the specified text column using the `progress_apply` method, which provides a progress bar for monitoring the processing status.\n",

Please bring back the option to remove contact from non-friends, so we can have some privacy. I think there’s use to be this option years ago. Now once you chat with non friends you will see each other active. For example if you contact thru Facebook marketplace you it will automatically add to your contact which you can’t remove and can only block. Which I don’t want to see anyone  on my block list. So overall 3 stars unless fixed with future updates.   \n",

       "51489  I havent been able to stay in connection with what is happening in Palestine because instagram keeps blocking most of the videos and posts and banning their spread. As a user that has the total freedom to follow whatever page i want and that expects to recieve the news i select, this have been useless lately because i no longer have the right nor the ability to chose the platforms i would like to be connected to. Only ridiculously useless pages on the top of the feeds with very unimportant content while disasterous unhumatarian events are happening all over the world with zero coverage and transparency. Hypocrite   \n",

    "### Summary of Sentiment vs. Ratings\n",
    "1. **Entry 1: Mooncycle**\n",
    "   - **Rating**: 4\n",
    "   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Very Positive\n",
    "   - **Comment**: The user provided a high rating (4 stars), and the sentiment analysis correctly identified a very positive sentiment. This indicates a good match between the expressed sentiment and the user's rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Entry 2: Privacy Concern**\n",
    "   - **Rating**: 3\n",
    "   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Neutral\n",
    "   - **Comment**: The review mentions significant concerns about privacy features but still gives a moderate rating of 3 stars. The sentiment analysis classified this as Neutral, which seems reasonable given the mix of positive and negative feedback. However, one might argue that a \"Slightly Negative\" label could better capture the overall tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Entry 3: Survey Payouts**\n",
    "   - **Rating**: 3\n",
    "   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Negative\n",
    "   - **Comment**: The user was disappointed with survey payouts, rating the experience as 3 stars. The sentiment analysis classified this as Negative, which reflects the user's dissatisfaction. The rating, however, seems higher than expected for a purely negative sentiment, suggesting potential leniency or mixed feelings not fully captured by the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Entry 4: Instagram Censorship**\n",
    "   - **Rating**: 1\n",
    "   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Very Negative\n",
    "   - **Comment**: This review strongly criticizes Instagram's content policies, and the user gave the lowest possible rating (1 star). The sentiment analysis accurately labeled this as Very Negative, showing a clear alignment between sentiment and rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Entry 5: Informative App**\n",
    "   - **Rating**: 5\n",
    "   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Very Positive\n",
    "   - **Comment**: The review is overwhelmingly positive, emphasizing the app's usefulness and unique features, and the user gave a 5-star rating. The sentiment analysis correctly labeled it as Very Positive, demonstrating alignment between the rating and sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "- **Alignment**: In most cases, the sentiment analysis aligns well with the user ratings. Positive sentiments correlate with higher ratings, while negative sentiments correspond to lower ratings.\n",
    "- **Mixed Reviews**: The Neutral sentiment for the privacy concern review highlights the complexity of mixed feedback, where both positives and negatives are present. This might require more nuanced classification.\n",
    "- **Alignment Between Sentiment and Rating**: In most cases, there is alignment between the sentiment analysis and user ratings. For instance, Very Positive sentiments are generally accompanied by high ratings (4 or 5), and Very Negative sentiments align with the lowest rating of 1.\n",
    "- **Neutral Sentiment vs. Moderate Rating**: For reviews with Neutral or Negative sentiment (Ratings: 3), the ratings reflect appreciation for the app's core value but reveal dissatisfaction with specific features or limitations.\n",
    "- **Sentiment Outliers**: No significant mismatches are observed here, suggesting that the sentiment analysis accurately reflects the reviewer’s stance in this sample. However, cases like Review 2 highlight how neutral sentiments can still accompany moderate ratings due to unfulfilled expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis indicates that sentiment analysis can generally align well with user ratings, offering insights into specific areas of dissatisfaction or satisfaction that might otherwise be missed in numerical ratings alone.\n",
