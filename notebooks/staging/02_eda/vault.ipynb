                "### Assumption and Justification for Treating Ratings as Interval Data\n",
                "For the purposes of this analysis, we assume that the ratings are measured on an interval scale. This implies that the differences between consecutive rating values are consistent and meaningful. Specifically, the difference in satisfaction between a rating of 1 and 2 is the same as between a rating of 4 and 5.\n",
                "\n",
                "### Theoretical Justification:\n",
                "1. **Interval Scale Properties**:\n",
                "   - **Equal Intervals**: Interval scales have equal intervals between points, which means that the difference between any two consecutive points on the scale is the same throughout the scale.\n",
                "   - **Arithmetic Operations**: Because interval scales have equal intervals, arithmetic operations such as addition and averaging are meaningful. This allows us to compute metrics like the average rating to summarize central tendency.\n",
                "\n",
                "2. **Ordinal vs. Interval**:\n",
                "   - **Ordinal Data**: Ratings can be considered ordinal, indicating a rank order without assuming equal intervals (e.g., 1-star is worse than 2-star, but the difference might not be the same as between 3-star and 4-star).\n",
                "   - **Interval Assumption**: By assuming equal intervals, we can leverage more sophisticated statistical techniques and derive summary statistics that can be easily interpreted and compared.\n",
                "\n",
                "### Precedent and Practical Use:\n",
                "1. **Industry Standard**:\n",
                "   - Many popular platforms and services (such as Amazon, IMDb, and Yelp) commonly calculate and display average ratings. This suggests a practical acceptance and precedent for treating ratings as interval data.\n",
                "   - These platforms provide average ratings as a key metric for summarizing user feedback and comparing different products, services, or categories.\n",
                "\n",
                "2. **Analytical Utility**:\n",
                "   - **Average Rating**: The average rating is a widely used and easily understood metric that provides a quick summary of overall user satisfaction.\n",
                "   - **Statistical Analysis**: Treating ratings as interval data allows us to perform more comprehensive statistical analyses, such as regression and correlation analysis, which require numerical data.\n",
                "\n",
                "### Practical Considerations:\n",
                "1. **Potential Bias**: It is important to recognize that the assumption of equal intervals might not perfectly reflect all users' perceptions. Some users may perceive the difference between certain ratings as larger or smaller than others.\n",
                "2. **Communication**: When presenting the results, we will clarify that the average rating is calculated based on the assumption of equal intervals and discuss any potential implications.\n",
                "\n",
                "By treating ratings as interval data, we align with common industry practices and leverage the full range of statistical tools available for numerical data. This approach allows us to compute average ratings and other summary statistics that provide valuable insights into user feedback and overall satisfaction."
